# Programs

## Manifest

The core program. This is the slim and efficient code, prioritizing attracting
router flow as well as reducing compute/rent usage for market makers.

## Wrapper

Example implementation of how a wrapper should work. The wrapper stores client
order ids. This is not expected to be used by everyone, in fact, some UIs might
want to make their own version of the wrapper which allows charging a UI fee.
