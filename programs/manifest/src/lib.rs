// Overview of some economic disincentive security assumptions. There are
// multiple ways to spam and cause hassle for honest traders. The strategy to
// combat the different ways largely relies on economic assumptions that by
// making it prohibitively expensive to grief honest traders.
//
// Denial of service through many small orders.
// Because each regular order requires funds to be placed on the market as well
// as possibly rent to expand an account, an attacker would have some associated
// cost. Particularly important is the cost of growing the market. If this
// happens, honest actors should simply create a new market and the rent that
// the attacker posted is irretrievable, thus making the attack only a temporary
// nuissance. If the market is full and no new seats can be claimed, the same
// mitigation applies.
//
// CU exhaustion
// Clients are expected to manage CU estimates on their own. There should not be
// a way to make a stuck market because an honest actor can reduce their size
// and take orders in their way. The gas cost to place the orders is nearly the
// same as to match through them, and the cleaner gets the reward of plus EV
// trades.
//
// Global order spam
// If a bad actor were to place many orders that were not backed across many
// markets, there is an added gas as well as input accounts cost for honest
// actors cancelling or matching them. To combat this, there is a gas prepayment
// of 5_000 lamports per order. Because of this, if there is ever multiple
// unbacked or expired global orders, it is now profitable for a 3rd party to
// run a cleanup job and claim the gas prepayment.
//
// Global seat squatting
// Because global accounts cannot be thrown away and started anew like markets,
// there needs to be a gating to who can use the bytes in the account. Also,
// there is a good reason to keep the account size small as it costs more CU to
// allow large accounts. To address this, there is a cap on the number of
// traders who can have a seat on a global account. To prevent squatting and
// guarantee that they are actually used, there is a mechanism for eviction. To
// evict someone and free up a seat, the evictor needs to deposit more than the
// lowest depositor to evict them. The evictee gets their tokens back, but their
// global orders are now unbacked and could have their gas prepayment claimed.
// This is a risk that global traders take when they leave themselves vulnerable
// to be evicted by keeping a low balance. There is a concern of a flash loan
// being able to evict many seats in one transaction. This however is protected
// by solana account limits because each evictee gets their tokens withdrawn, so
// an account is needed per eviction, and that will quickly run into the solana
// transaction limit before an attacker is able to clear a substantial number of
// seats in one transaction.
